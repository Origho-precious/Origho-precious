# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, 
I'm a Software Engineer, I love to build interactive Applications with beautiful User Interfaces, and build APIs to be consumed by client side of applications. When I'm not coding or learning new things, You'd either see me watching football(Soccer), reading online, watching a movie, pestering my friends or playing video games.
